							<p>I look for the way <br />
things will turn <br />
out spiralling from a center, <br />
the shape <br />
things will take to come forth in <br />
<br />
so that the birch tree white <br />
touched black at branches <br />
will stand out <br />
wind-glittering <br />
totally its apparent self: <br />
<br />
I look for the forms <br />
things want to come as <br />
<br />
from what black wells of possibility, <br />
how a thing will <br />
unfold: <br />
<br />
not the shape on paper -- though <br />
that, too -- but the <br />
uninterfering means on paper: <br />
<br />
not so much looking for the shape <br />
as being available <br />
to any shape that may be <br />
summoning itself <br />
through me <br />
from the self not mine but ours.</p>
