							<p>The reason to be autonomous is to stand there, <br />
a cleared instrument, ready to act, to search <br />
<br />
the moral realm and actual conditions for what <br />
needs to be done and to do it: fine, the <br />
<br />
best, if it works out, but if, like a gun, it <br />
comes in handy to the wrong choice, why then <br />
<br />
you see the danger in the effective: better <br />
then an autonomy that stands and looks about, <br />
<br />
negotiating nothing, the supreme indifferences: <br />
is anything to be gained where as much is lost: <br />
<br />
and if for every action there is an equal and <br />
opposite reaction has the loss been researched <br />
<br />
equally with the gain: you can see how the <br />
milling actions of millions could come to a <br />
<br />
buzzard-like glide as from a coincidental, <br />
warm bottom of water stuck between chilled <br />
<br />
peaks: it is not so easy to say, OK, go on <br />
out and act: who, doing what, to what or <br />
<br />
whom: just a minute: should the bunker be <br />
bombed (if it stores gas): should all the <br />
<br />
rattlers die just because they rattle: if I <br />
hear the young gentleman vomiter roaring down <br />
<br />
the hall in the men's room, should I go and <br />
inquire of him, reducing him to my care: no <br />
<br />
wonder the great sayers (who say nothing) sit <br />
about in inaccessible states of mind: no <br />
<br />
wonder still wisdom and catatonia appear to <br />
exchange places occasionally: but if anything <br />
<br />
were easy, our easy choices soon would carry <br />
away our ignorance with the world-better <br />
<br />
let the mixed-up mix and let the surface shine <br />
with all the possibilities, each in itself.</p>
