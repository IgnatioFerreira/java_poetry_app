							<p>We are thine, O Love, being in thee and made of thee, <br />
As théou, Léove, were the déep thought <br />
And we the speech of the thought; yea, spoken are we, <br />
Thy fires of thought out-spoken: <br />
<br />
But burn’d not through us thy imagining <br />
Like fiérce méood in a séong céaught, <br />
We were as clamour’d words a fool may fling, <br />
Loose words, of meaning broken. <br />
<br />
For what more like the brainless speech of a fool,— <br />
The lives travelling dark fears, <br />
And as a boy throws pebbles in a pool <br />
Thrown down abysmal places? <br />
<br />
Hazardous are the stars, yet is our birth <br />
And our journeying time theirs; <br />
As words of air, life makes of starry earth <br />
Sweet soul-delighted faces; <br />
<br />
As voices are we in the worldly wind; <br />
The great wind of the world’s fate <br />
Is turn’d, as air to a shapen sound, to mind <br />
And marvellous desires. <br />
<br />
But not in the world as voices storm-shatter’d, <br />
Not borne down by the wind’s weight; <br />
The rushing time rings with our splendid word <br />
Like darkness fill’d with fires. <br />
<br />
For Love doth use us for a sound of song, <br />
And Love’s meaning our life wields, <br />
Making our souls like syllables to throng <br />
His tunes of exultation. <br />
<br />
Down the blind speed of a fatal world we fly, <br />
As rain blown along earth’s fields; <br />
Yet are we god-desiring liturgy, <br />
Sung joys of adoration; <br />
<br />
Yea, made of chance and all a labouring strife, <br />
We go charged with a strong flame; <br />
For as a language Love hath seized on life <br />
His burning heart to story. <br />
<br />
Yea, Love, we are thine, the liturgy of thee, <br />
Thy thought’s golden and glad name, <br />
The mortal conscience of immortal glee, <br />
Love’s zeal in Love’s own glory.</p>
