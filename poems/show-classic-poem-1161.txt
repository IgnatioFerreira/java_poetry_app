							<p>You think the ridge hills flowing, breaking <br />
with ups and downs will, though, <br />
building constancy into the black foreground <br />
<br />
for each sunset, hold on to you, if dreams <br />
wander, give reality recurrence enough to keep <br />
an image clear, but then you realize, time <br />
<br />
going on, that time's residual like the last <br />
ice age's cool still in the rocks, averaged <br />
maybe with the cool of the age before, that <br />
<br />
not only are you not being held onto but where <br />
else could time do so well without you, <br />
what is your time where so much time is saved?</p>
