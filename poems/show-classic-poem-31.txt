							<p>Once upon a time, in the land of Hush-A-Bye, <br />
Around about the wondrous days of yore, <br />
They came across a kind of box <br />
Bound up with chains and locked with locks <br />
And labeled "Kindly do not touch; it's war." <br />
A decree was issued round about, and all with a flourish and a shout <br />
And a gaily colored mascot tripping lightly on before. <br />
Don't fiddle with this deadly box,Or break the chains, or pick the locks. <br />
And please don't ever play about with war. <br />
The children understood. Children happen to be good <br />
And they were just as good around the time of yore. <br />
They didn't try to pick the locks Or break into that deadly box. <br />
They never tried to play about with war. <br />
Mommies didn't either; sisters, aunts, grannies neither <br />
'Cause they were quiet, and sweet, and pretty <br />
In those wondrous days of yore. <br />
Well, very much the same as now, <br />
And not the ones to blame somehow <br />
For opening up that deadly box of war. <br />
But someone did. Someone battered in the lid <br />
And spilled the insides out across the floor. <br />
A kind of bouncy, bumpy ball made up of guns and flags <br />
And all the tears, and horror, and death that comes with war. <br />
It bounced right out and went bashing all about, <br />
Bumping into everything in store.And what was sad and most unfair <br />
Was that it didn't really seem to care <br />
Much who it bumped, or why, or what, or for. <br />
It bumped the children mainly. And I'll tell you this quite plainly, <br />
It bumps them every day and more, and more, <br />
And leaves them dead, and burned, and dying <br />
Thousands of them sick and crying. <br />
'Cause when it bumps, it's really very sore. <br />
Now there's a way to stop the ball. It isn't difficult at all. <br />
All it takes is wisdom, and I'm absolutely sure <br />
That we can get it back into the box,And bind the chains, and lock the locks. <br />
But no one seems to want to save the children anymore. <br />
Well, that's the way it all appears, 'cause it's been bouncing round <br />
for years and years <br />
In spite of all the wisdom wizzed since those wondrous days of yore <br />
And the time they came across the box, <br />
Bound up with chains and locked with locks, <br />
And labeled "Kindly do not touch; it's war."</p>
