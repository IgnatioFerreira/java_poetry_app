							<p>I don't know somehow it seems sufficient <br />
to see and hear whatever coming and going is, <br />
losing the self to the victory <br />
  of stones and trees, <br />
of bending sandpit lakes, crescent <br />
round groves of dwarf pine: <br />
<br />
for it is not so much to know the self <br />
as to know it as it is known <br />
  by galaxy and cedar cone, <br />
as if birth had never found it <br />
and death could never end it: <br />
<br />
the swamp's slow water comes <br />
down Gravelly Run fanning the long <br />
  stone-held algal <br />
hair and narrowing roils between <br />
the shoulders of the highway bridge: <br />
<br />
holly grows on the banks in the woods there, <br />
and the cedars' gothic-clustered <br />
  spires could make <br />
green religion in winter bones: <br />
<br />
so I look and reflect, but the air's glass <br />
jail seals each thing in its entity: <br />
<br />
no use to make any philosophies here: <br />
  I see no <br />
god in the holly, hear no song from <br />
the snowbroken weeds: Hegel is not the winter <br />
yellow in the pines: the sunlight has never <br />
heard of trees: surrendered self among <br />
  unwelcoming forms: stranger, <br />
hoist your burdens, get on down the road.</p>
