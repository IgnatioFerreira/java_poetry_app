							<p>I know if I find you I will have to leave the earth <br />
and go on out <br />
  over the sea marshes and the brant in bays <br />
and over the hills of tall hickory <br />
and over the crater lakes and canyons <br />
and on up through the spheres of diminishing air <br />
past the blackset noctilucent clouds <br />
          where one wants to stop and look <br />
way past all the light diffusions and bombardments <br />
up farther than the loss of sight <br />
  into the unseasonal undifferentiated empty stark <br />
<br />
And I know if I find you I will have to stay with the earth <br />
inspecting with thin tools and ground eyes <br />
trusting the microvilli sporangia and simplest <br />
  coelenterates <br />
and praying for a nerve cell <br />
with all the soul of my chemical reactions <br />
and going right on down where the eye sees only traces <br />
<br />
You are everywhere partial and entire <br />
You are on the inside of everything and on the outside <br />
<br />
I walk down the path down the hill where the sweetgum <br />
has begun to ooze spring sap at the cut <br />
and I see how the bark cracks and winds like no other bark <br />
chasmal to my ant-soul running up and down <br />
and if I find you I must go out deep into your <br />
  far resolutions <br />
and if I find you I must stay here with the separate leaves</p>
