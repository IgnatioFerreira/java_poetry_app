							<p>I said I will find what is lowly<br />
and put the roots of my identity<br />
down there:<br />
each day I'll wake up<br />
and find the lowly nearby,<br />
a handy focus and reminder,<br />
a ready measure of my significance,<br />
the voice by which I would be heard,<br />
the wills, the kinds of selfishness<br />
I could<br />
freely adopt as my own:<br />
<br />
but though I have looked everywhere,<br />
I can find nothing<br />
to give myself to:<br />
everything is<br />
<br />
magnificent with existence, is in <br />
surfeit of glory:<br />
nothing is diminished,<br />
nothing has been diminished for me:<br />
<br />
I said what is more lowly than the grass:<br />
ah, underneath,<br />
a ground-crust of dry-burnt moss:<br />
I looked at it closely<br />
and said this can be my habitat: but<br />
nestling in I<br />
found<br />
below the brown exterior<br />
green mechanisms beyond the intellect<br />
awaiting resurrection in rain: so I got up<br />
<br />
and ran saying there is nothing lowly in the universe:<br />
I found a beggar:<br />
he had stumps for legs: nobody was paying<br />
him any attention: everybody went on by:<br />
I nestled in and found his life:<br />
there, love shook his body like a devastation:<br />
I said<br />
though I have looked everywhere<br />
I can find nothing lowly<br />
in the universe:<br />
<br />
I whirled though transfigurations up and down,<br />
transfigurations of size and shape and place:<br />
<br />
at one sudden point came still,<br />
stood in wonder:<br />
moss, beggar, weed, tick, pine, self, magnificent<br />
with being!</p>
