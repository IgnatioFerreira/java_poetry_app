							<p>When you consider the radiance, that it does not withhold <br />
itself but pours its abundance without selection into every <br />
nook and cranny not overhung or hidden; when you consider <br />
<br />
that birds' bones make no awful noise against the light but <br />
lie low in the light as in a high testimony; when you consider <br />
the radiance, that it will look into the guiltiest <br />
<br />
swervings of the weaving heart and bear itself upon them, <br />
not flinching into disguise or darkening; when you consider <br />
the abundance of such resource as illuminates the glow-blue <br />
<br />
bodies and gold-skeined wings of flies swarming the dumped <br />
guts of a natural slaughter or the coil of shit and in no <br />
way winces from its storms of generosity; when you consider <br />
<br />
that air or vacuum, snow or shale, squid or wolf, rose or lichen, <br />
each is accepted into as much light as it will take, then <br />
the heart moves roomier, the man stands and looks about, the <br />
<br />
leaf does not increase itself above the grass, and the dark <br />
work of the deepest cells is of a tune with May bushes <br />
and fear lit by the breadth of such calmly turns to praise.</p>
