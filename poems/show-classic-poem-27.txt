							<p>She<br />
<br />
ONLY to be twin elements of joy  <br />
In this extravagance of Being, Love,  <br />
Were our divided natures shaped in twain;  <br />
And to this hour the whole world must consent.  <br />
Is it not very marvellous, our lives          <br />
Can only come to this out of a long  <br />
Strange sundering, with the years of the world between us?  <br />
 <br />
He<br />
<br />
 Shall life do more than God? for hath not God  <br />
Striven with himself, when into known delight  <br />
His unaccomplisht joy he would put forth,—         <br />
This mystery of a world sign of his striving?  <br />
Else wherefore this, a thing to break the mind  <br />
With labouring in the wonder of it, that here  <br />
Being—the world and we—is suffered to be!—  <br />
But, lying on thy breast one notable day,        <br />
Sudden exceeding agony of love  <br />
Made my mind a trance of infinite knowledge.  <br />
I was not: yet I saw the will of God  <br />
As light unfashion’d, unendurable flame,  <br />
Interminable, not to be supposed;        <br />
And there was no more creature except light,—  <br />
The dreadful burning of the lonely God’s  <br />
Unutter’d joy. And then, past telling, came  <br />
Shuddering and division in the light:  <br />
Therein, like trembling, was desire to know         <br />
Its own perfect beauty; and it became  <br />
A cloven fire, a double flaming, each  <br />
Adorable to each; against itself  <br />
Waging a burning love, which was the world;—  <br />
A moment satisfied in that love-strife         <br />
I knew the world!—And when I fell from there,  <br />
Then knew I also what this life would do  <br />
In being twin,—in being man and woman!  <br />
For it would do even as its endless Master,  <br />
Making the world, had done; yea, with itself         <br />
Would strive, and for the strife would into sex  <br />
Be cloven, double burning, made thereby  <br />
Desirable to itself. Contrivèd joy  <br />
Is sex in life; and by no other thing  <br />
Than by a perfect sundering, could life         <br />
Change the dark stream of unappointed joy  <br />
To perfect praise of itself, the glee that loves  <br />
And worships its own Being. This is ours!  <br />
Yet only for that we have been so long  <br />
Sundered desire: thence is our life all praise.—        <br />
But we, well knowing by our strength of joy  <br />
There is no sundering more, how far we love  <br />
From those sad lives that know a half-love only,  <br />
Alone thereby knowing themselves for ever  <br />
Sealed in division of love, and therefore made        <br />
To pour their strength always into their love’s  <br />
Fierceness, as green wood bleeds its hissing sap  <br />
Into red heat of a fire! Not so do we:  <br />
The cloven anger, life, hath left to wage  <br />
Its flame against itself, here turned to one        <br />
Self-adoration.—Ah, what comes of this?  <br />
The joy falters a moment, with closed wings  <br />
Wearying in its upward journey, ere  <br />
Again it goes on high, bearing its song,  <br />
Its delight breathing and its vigour beating        <br />
The highest height of the air above the world.  <br />
 <br />
She<br />
<br />
 What hast thou done to me!—I would have soul,  <br />
Before I knew thee, Love, a captive held  <br />
By flesh. Now, inly delighted with desire,  <br />
My body knows itself to be nought else        <br />
But thy heart’s worship of me; and my soul  <br />
Therein is sunlight held by warm gold air.  <br />
Nay, all my body is become a song  <br />
Upon the breath of spirit, a love-song.  <br />
 <br />
He<br />
<br />
 And mine is all like one rapt faculty,         <br />
As it were listening to the love in thee,  <br />
My whole mortality trembling to take  <br />
Thy body like heard singing of thy spirit.  <br />
 <br />
She<br />
<br />
 Surely by this, Beloved, we must know  <br />
Our love is perfect here,—that not as holds         <br />
The common dullard thought, we are things lost  <br />
In an amazement that is all unware;  <br />
But wonderfully knowing what we are!  <br />
Lo, now that body is the song whereof  <br />
Spirit is mood, knoweth not our delight?        <br />
Knoweth not beautifully now our love,  <br />
That Life, here to this festival bid come  <br />
Clad in his splendour of worldly day and night,  <br />
Filled and empower’d by heavenly lust, is all  <br />
The glad imagination of the Spirit?        <br />
 <br />
He<br />
<br />
 Were it not so, Love could not be at all:  <br />
Nought could be, but a yearning to fulfil  <br />
Desire of beauty, by vain reaching forth  <br />
Of sense to hold and understand the vision  <br />
Made by impassion’d body,—vision of thee!        <br />
But music mixt with music are, in love,  <br />
Bodily senses; and as flame hath light,  <br />
Spirit this nature hath imagined round it,  <br />
No way concealed therein, when love comes near,  <br />
Nor in the perfect wedding of desires        <br />
Suffering any hindrance.  <br />
 <br />
She<br />
<br />
 Ah, but now,  <br />
Now am I given love’s eternal secret!  <br />
Yea, thou and I who speak, are but the joy  <br />
Of our for ever mated spirits; but now        <br />
The wisdom of my gladness even through Spirit  <br />
Looks, divinely elate. Who hath for joy  <br />
Our Spirits? Who hath imagined them  <br />
Round him in fashion’d radiance of desire,  <br />
As into light of these exulting bodies        <br />
Flaming Spirit is uttered?  <br />
 <br />
He<br />
<br />
 Yea, here the end  <br />
Of love’s astonishment! Now know we Spirit,  <br />
And Who, for ease of joy, contriveth Spirit.  <br />
Now all life’s loveliness and power we have        <br />
Dissolved in this one moment, and our burning  <br />
Carries all shining upward, till in us  <br />
Life is not life, but the desire of God,  <br />
Himself desiring and himself accepting.  <br />
Now what was prophecy in us is made        <br />
Fulfilment: we are the hour and we are the joy,  <br />
We in our marvellousness of single knowledge,  <br />
Of Spirit breaking down the room of fate  <br />
And drawing into his light the greeting fire  <br />
Of God,—God known in ecstasy of love        <br />
Wedding himself to utterance of himself</p>
