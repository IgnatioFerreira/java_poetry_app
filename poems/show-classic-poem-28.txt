							<p>WHAT thing shall be held up to woman's beauty?   <br />
Where are the bounds of it? Yea, what is all   <br />
The world, but an awning scaffolded amid   <br />
The waste perilous Eternity, to lodge   <br />
This Heaven-wander'd princess, woman's beauty?           <br />
The East and West kneel down to thee, the North   <br />
And South; and all for thee their shoulders bear   <br />
The load of fourfold space. As yellow morn   <br />
Runs on the slippery waves of the spread sea,   <br />
Thy feet are on the griefs and joys of men     <br />
That sheen to be thy causey. Out of tears   <br />
Indeed, and blitheness, murder and lust and love,   <br />
Whatever has been passionate in clay,   <br />
Thy flesh was tempered. Behold in thy body   <br />
The yearnings of all men measured and told,     <br />
Insatiate endless agonies of desire   <br />
Given thy flesh, the meaning of thy shape!   <br />
What beauty is there, but thou makest it?   <br />
How is earth good to look on, woods and fields,   <br />
The season's garden, and the courageous hills,     <br />
All this green raft of earth moored in the seas?   <br />
The manner of the sun to ride the air,   <br />
The stars God has imagined for the night?   <br />
What's this behind them, that we cannot near,   <br />
Secret still on the point of being blabbed,     <br />
The ghost in the world that flies from being named?   <br />
Where do they get their beauty from, all these?   <br />
They do but glaze a lantern lit for man,   <br />
And woman's beauty is the flame therein.</p>
