							<p>A quay with vessels moored <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 To India! Yea, here I may take ship; <br />
                 From here the courses go over the seas, <br />
                 Along which the intent prows wonderfully <br />
                 Nose like lean hounds, and tack their journeys out, <br />
                 Making for harbours as some sleuth was laid <br />
                 For them to follow on their shifting road. <br />
                 Again I front my appointed ministry. -- <br />
                 But why the Indian lot to me? Why mine <br />
                 Such fearful gospelling? For the Lord knew <br />
                 What a frail soul He gave me, and a heart <br />
                 Lame and unlikely for the large events. -- <br />
                 And this is worse than Baghdad! though that was <br />
                 A fearful brink of travel. But if the lots, <br />
                 That gave to me the Indian duty, were <br />
                 Shuffled by the unseen skill of Heaven, surely <br />
                 That fear of mine in Baghdad was the same <br />
                 Marvellous Hand working again, to guard <br />
                 The landward gate of India from me. There <br />
                 I stood, waiting in the weak early dawn <br />
                 To start my journey; the great caravan's <br />
                 Strange cattle with their snoring breaths made steam <br />
                 Upon the air, and (as I thought) sadly <br />
                 The beasts at market-booths and awnings gay <br />
                 Of shops, the city's comfortable trade, <br />
                 Lookt, and then into months of plodding lookt. <br />
                 And swiftly on my brain there came a wind <br />
                 Of vision; and I saw the road mapt out <br />
                 Along the desert with a chalk of bones; <br />
                 I saw a famine and the Afghan greed <br />
                 Waiting for us, spears at our throats, all we <br />
                 Made women by our hunger; and I saw <br />
                 Gigantic thirst grieving our mouths with dust, <br />
                 Scattering up against our breathing salt <br />
                 Of blown dried dung, till the taste eat like fires <br />
                 Of a wild vinegar into our sheath√®d marrows; <br />
                 And a sudden decay thicken'd all our bloods <br />
                 As rotten leaves in fall will baulk a stream; <br />
                 Then my kill'd life the muncht food of jackals. -- <br />
                 The wind of vision died in my brain; and lo, <br />
                 The jangling of the caravan's long gait <br />
                 Was small as the luting of a breeze in grass <br />
                 Upon my ears. Into the waiting thirst <br />
                 Camels and merchants all were gone, while I <br />
                 Had been in my amazement. Was this not <br />
                 A sign? God with a vision tript me, lest <br />
                 Those tall fiends that ken for my approach <br />
                 In middle Asia, Thirst and his grisly band <br />
                 Of plagues, should with their brigand fingers stop <br />
                 His message in my mouth. Therefore I said, <br />
                 If India is the place where I must preach, <br />
                 I am to go by ship, not overland. <br />
                 And here my ship is berthed. But worse, far worse <br />
                 Than Baghdad, is this roadstead, the brown sails, <br />
                 All the enginery of going on sea, <br />
                 The tackle and the rigging, tholes and sweeps, <br />
                 The prows built to put by the waves, the masts <br />
                 Stayed for a hurricane; and lo, that line <br />
                 Of gilded water there! the sun has drawn <br />
                 In a long narrow band of shining oil <br />
                 His light over the sea; how evilly move <br />
                 Ripples along that golden skin! -- the gleam <br />
                 Works like a muscular thing! like the half-gorged <br />
                 Sleepy swallowing of a serpent's neck. <br />
                 The sea lives, surely! My eyes swear to it; <br />
                 And, like a murderous smile that glimpses through <br />
                 A villain's courtesy, that twitching dazzle <br />
                 Parts the kind mood of weather to bewray <br />
                 The feasted waters of the sea, stretched out <br />
                 In lazy gluttony, expecting prey. <br />
                 How fearful is this trade of sailing! Worse <br />
                 Than all land-evils is the water-way <br />
                 Before me now. -- What, cowardice? Nay, why <br />
                 Trouble myself with ugly words? 'Tis prudence, <br />
                 And prudence is an admirable thing. <br />
                 Yet here's much cost -- these packages piled up, <br />
                 Ivory doubless, emeralds, gums, and silks, <br />
                 All these they trust on shipboard? Ah, but I, <br />
                 I who have seen God, I to put myself <br />
                 Amid the heathen outrage of the sea <br />
                 In a deal-wood box! It were plain folly. <br />
                 There is naught more precious in the world than I: <br />
                 I carry God in me, to give to men. <br />
                 And when has the sea been friendly unto man? <br />
                 Let it but guess my errand, it will call <br />
                 The dangers of the air to wreak upon me, <br />
                 Winds to juggle the puny boat and pinch <br />
                 The water into unbelievable creases. <br />
                 And shall my soul, and God in my soul, drown? <br />
                 Or venture drowning? -- But no, no; I am safe. <br />
                 Smooth as believing souls over their deaths <br />
                 And over agonies shall slide henceforth <br />
                 To God, so shall my way be blest amid <br />
                 The quiet crouching terrors of the sea, <br />
                 Like panthers when a fire weakens their hearts; <br />
                 Ay, this huge sin of nature, the salt sea, <br />
                 Shall be afraid of me, and of the mind <br />
                 Within me, that with gesture, speech and eyes <br />
                 Of the Messiah flames. What element <br />
                 Dare snarl against my going, what incubus dare <br />
                 Remember to be fiendish, when I light <br />
                 My whole being with memory of Him? <br />
                 The malice of the sea will slink from me, <br />
                 And the air be harmless as a muzzled wolf; <br />
                 For I am a torch, and the flame of me is God. <br />
           A Ship's Captain <br />
                 You are my man, my passenger? <br />
           Thomas                                I am. <br />
                 I go to India with you. <br />
           Captain                         Well, I hope so. <br />
                 There's threatening in the weather. Have you a mind <br />
                 To hug your belly to the slanted deck, <br />
                 Like a louse on a whip-top, when the boat <br />
                 Spins on an axlie in the hissing gales? <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 Fear not. 'Tis likely indeed that storms are now <br />
                 Plotting against our voyage; ay, no doubt <br />
                 The very bottom of the sea prepares <br />
                 To stand up mountainous or reach a limb <br />
                 Out of his night of water and huge shingles, <br />
                 That he and the waves may break our keel. Fear not; <br />
                 Like those who manage horses, I've a word <br />
                 Will fasten up within their evil natures <br />
                 The meanings of the winds and waves and reefs. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 You have a talisman? I have one too; <br />
                 I know not if the storms think much of it. <br />
                 I may be shark's meat yet. And would your spell <br />
                 Be daunting to a cuttle, think you now? <br />
                 We had a bout with one on our way here; <br />
                 It had green lidless eyes like lanterns, arms <br />
                 As many as the branches of a tree, <br />
                 But limber, and each one of them wise as a snake. <br />
                 It laid hold of our bulwarks, and with three <br />
                 Long knowing arms, slimy, and of a flesh <br />
                 So tough they'ld fool a hatchet, searcht the ship, <br />
                 And stole out of the midst of us all a man; <br />
                 Yes, and he the proudest man upon the seas <br />
                 For the rare powerful talisman he'd got. <br />
                 And would yours have done better? <br />
           Thomas                             I am one <br />
                 Not easily frightened. I'm for India. <br />
                 You will not putme from my way with talk. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 My heart, I never thought of frightening you. -- <br />
                 Well, here's both tide and wind, and we may not start. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 Not start? I pray you, do. <br />
           Captain                    It's no use praying; <br />
                 I dare not. I've not half my cargo yet. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 What do you wait for, then? <br />
           Captain                          A carpenter. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 You are talking strangely. <br />
           Captain                          But not idly. <br />
                 I might as well broach all my blood at once, <br />
                 Here as I stand, as sail to India back <br />
                 Without a carpenter on board; -- O strangely <br />
                 Wise are our kings in the killing of men! <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 But does your king then need a carpenter? <br />
           Captain <br />
                 Yes, for he dreamed a dream; and(like a man <br />
                 Who, having eaten poison, and with all <br />
                 Force of his life turned out the crazing drug, <br />
                 Has only a weak and wrestled nature left <br />
                 That gives in foolishly to some bad desire <br />
                 A healthy man would laught at; so our king <br />
                 Is left desiring by his venomous dream. <br />
                 But, being a king, the whole land aches with him. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 What dream was that? <br />
           Captain                    A palace made of souls; -- <br />
                 Ay, there's a folly for a man to dream! <br />
                 He saw a palace covering all the land, <br />
                 Big as the day itself, made of a stone <br />
                 That answered with a better gleam than glass <br />
                 To the sun's greeting, fashioned like the sound <br />
                 Of laughter copied into shining shape: <br />
                 So the king said. And with him in the dream <br />
                 There was a voice that fleered upon the king: <br />
                 'This is the man who makes much of himself <br />
                 For filling the common eyes with palaces <br />
                 Gorgeously bragging out his royalty: <br />
                 Whereas he hath not one that seemeth not <br />
                 In work, in height, in posture on the ground, <br />
                 A hut, a peasant's dingy shed, to mine. <br />
                 And all his excellent woods, metals, and stones, <br />
                 The things he's filched out of the earth's old pockets <br />
                 And hoisted up into walls and domes; the gold, <br />
                 Ebony, agate stairs, wainscots of jade, <br />
                 The windows of jargoon, and heavenly lofts <br />
                 Of marble, all the stuff he takes to be wealth, <br />
                 Reckons like savage mud and wattle against <br />
                 The matter of my building.' -- And the king, <br />
                 Gloating upon the white sheen of that palace, <br />
                 And weeping like a girl ashamed, inquired <br />
                 'What is that stone?' And the voice answered him, <br />
                 'Soul.' 'But in my palaces too,' said he, <br />
                 'There should be soul built: I have driven nations, <br />
                 What with quarrying, what with craning, down <br />
                 To death, and sure their souls stay in my work.' <br />
                 And 'Mud and wattle' sneered the voice again; <br />
                 But added, 'In the west there is a man, <br />
                 A slave, a carpenter, whose heart has been <br />
                 Apprenticed to the skill that built my reign, <br />
                 This beauty; and were he master of your gangs, <br />
                 He'ld build you a palace that would look like mine.' -- <br />
                 So now no ship may sail from India, <br />
                 Since the king's scornful dream, unless it bring <br />
                 A carpenter among its homeward lading: <br />
                 And carpenters are getting hard to find. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 And have none made for the king his desire? <br />
           Captain <br />
                 Many have tried, with roasting living men <br />
                 In queer huge kilns, and other sleights, to found <br />
                 A glass of human souls; and others seek <br />
                 With marvellous stone to please our desperate king. <br />
                 Always at last their own tormented bodies <br />
                 Delight the cruelty of the king's heart. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 Well then, I hope you'll find your carpenter, <br />
                 And soon. I would not that we wait too long; <br />
                 I loathe a dallying journey. -- I should suppose <br />
                 We'ld have good sailing at this season, now? <br />
           Captain <br />
                 Why, you were looking, a few minutes gone, <br />
                 For rare wild storms: I hope we'll have them too; <br />
                 I want to see you work that talisman <br />
                 You boast about: I've a great love for spells. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 Let it be storm or calm, so we be sailing. <br />
                 I long have wished to voyage into mid sea, <br />
                 To give my senses rest from wondering <br />
                 On this preplex√®d grammar of the land <br />
                 Written in men and women, the strange trees, <br />
                 Herbs, and those things so like to souls, the beasts. <br />
                 My wilful senses will keep perilously <br />
                 Employed with these my brain, and weary it <br />
                 Still to be asking. But on the high seas <br />
                 Such throng'd reality is left behind, -- <br />
                 Only vast air and water, and the hue <br />
                 That always seems like special news of God. <br />
                 Surely 'tis half way to eternity <br />
                 To go where only size and colour live; <br />
                 And I could purify my mind from all <br />
                 Worldly amazement by imagining <br />
                 Beyond my senses into God's great Heaven, <br />
                 If I were in mid sea. I have dreamed of this. <br />
                 Wondrous too, I think, to sail at night <br />
                 While shaols of moonlight flickers dance beside, <br />
                 Like swimming glee of fishes scaled in gold, <br />
                 Curvetting in thwart bounds over the swell; <br />
                 The perceiving flesh, in bliss of such a beauty, <br />
                 Must sure feel fine as spiritual sight. -- <br />
                 Moods have been on me, too, when I would be <br />
                 Sailing recklessly through wild darkness, where <br />
                 Gigantic whispers of a harassed sea <br />
                 Fill the whole world of air, and I stand up <br />
                 To breast the danger of the loosen'd sky, <br />
                 And feel my immortality like music, -- <br />
                 Yea, I alone in the broken world, firm things <br />
                 All gone to monstrous flurry, knowing myself <br />
                 An indestructible word spoken by God. -- <br />
                 This is a small, small boat? <br />
           Captain                  Small is nothing, <br />
                 A bucket will do, so it know how to ride <br />
                 Top upward: cleverness is the thing in boats. <br />
                 And I wish this were cleverer: she goes crank <br />
                 At times just when she should go sober. <br />
                 But what? Boats are but girls for whimsies: men <br />
                 Must let them have their freaks. <br />
           Thomas                      Have you good skill <br />
                 In seamanship? <br />
           Captain            Well, I am not drowned yet, <br />
                 Though I'm a grey man and have been at sea <br />
                 Longer than you've been walking. My old sight <br />
                 Can tell Mizar from Alcor still. <br />
           Thomas                            Ay, so; <br />
                 Doubtless you'll bring me safe to India. <br />
                 But being there -- tell me now of the land: <br />
                 How use they strangers there? <br />
           Captain                      Queerly, sometimes <br />
                 If the king's moody, and tired of feeling nerves <br />
                 Mildly made happy with soft jewels of silk, <br />
                 Odours and wines and slim lascivious girls, <br />
                 And yearns for sharper thrills to pierce his brain, <br />
                 He often finds a stranger handy then. <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 Why, what do you mean? <br />
           Captain                There was a merchant came <br />
                 To Travancore, and could not speak our talk; <br />
                 And, it chanced, he was brought before the throne <br />
                 Just when the king was weary of sweet pleasures. <br />
                 So, to better his tongue, a rope was bent <br />
                 Beneath his oxters, up he was hauled, and fire <br />
                 Let singe the soles of his feet, until his legs <br />
                 Wriggled like frying eels; then the king's dogs <br />
                 Were set to hunt the hirpling man. The king <br />
                 Laught greatly and cried, 'But give the dogs words they know, <br />
                 And they'll be tame.' -- Have you the Indian speech? <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 Not yet: it will be given me, I trust. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 You'd best make sure of the gift. Another stranger, <br />
                 Who swore he knew of better gods than ours, <br />
                 Seemed to the king troubled with fleas, and slaves <br />
                 Were told to groom him smartly, which they did <br />
                 Thoroughly with steel combs, until at last <br />
                 They curried the living flesh from his bones <br />
                 And stript his face of gristle, till he was <br />
                 Skull and half skeleton and yet alive. <br />
                 You're not for dealing in new gods? <br />
           Thomas                            Not I. <br />
                 Was the man killed? <br />
           Captain                  He lived a little while; <br />
                 But the flies killed him. <br />
           Thomas                      Flies? I hope India <br />
                 Is not a fly-plagued land? I abhor flies. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 You will see strange ones, for our Indian life <br />
                 Hath wonderful fierce breeding. Common earth <br />
                 With us quickens to buzzing flights of wings <br />
                 As readily as a week-old carcase here <br />
                 Thrown in a sunny marsh. Why, we have wasps <br />
                 That make your hornets seem like pretty midges; <br />
                 And there be flies in India will drink <br />
                 Not only blood of bulls, tigers, and bears, <br />
                 But pierce the river-horses' creasy leather, <br />
                 Ay, worry crocodiles through their cuirasses <br />
                 And prick the metal fishes when they bask. <br />
                 You'll feel them soon, with beaks like sturdy pins, <br />
                 Treating their stinging thirsts with your best blood. <br />
                 A man can't walk a mile in India <br />
                 Without being the business of a throng'd <br />
                 And moving town of flies; they hawk at a man <br />
                 As bold as little eagles, and as wild. <br />
                 And, I suppose, only a fool will blame them. <br />
                 Flies have the right to sink wells in our skin <br />
                 All as men to bore parcht earth for water. <br />
                 But I must do a job on board, and then <br />
                 Search the town afresh for a carpenter. <br />
           Thomas (alone) <br />
                 Ay, loose tongue, I know how thou art prompted. <br />
                 Satan's cunning device thou art, to sap <br />
                 My heart with chatter'd fears. How easy it is <br />
                 For a stiff mind to hold itself upright <br />
                 Against the cords of devilish suggestion <br />
                 Tackled about it, though kept downward strained <br />
                 With sly, masterful winches made of fear. <br />
                 Yea, when the mind is warned what engines mean <br />
                 To ply it into grovelling, and thought set firm, <br />
                 The tugging strings fail like a cobweb-stuff. <br />
                 Not as in Baghdad is it with me now; <br />
                 Nor canst thou, Satan, by a prating mouth, <br />
                 Fell my tall purpose to a flatlong scorn. <br />
                 I can divide the check of God's own hand <br />
                 From tempting such as this: India is mine! -- <br />
                 Ay, fiend, and if thou utter thy storming heart <br />
                 Into the ocean sea, as into mob <br />
                 A rebel utters turbulence and rage, <br />
                 And raise before my path swelling barriers <br />
                 Of hatred soul'd in water, yet will I strike <br />
                 My purpose, and God's purpose, clean through all <br />
                 The ridges of thy power. And I will show <br />
                 This mask that the devil wears, this old shipman, <br />
                 A thing to make his proud heart of evil <br />
                 Writhe like a trodden snake; yea, he shall see <br />
                 How godly faith can go upon the huge Fury of forces bursting out of law, <br />
                 Easily as a boy goes on windy grass. -- <br />
                 O marvel! that my little life of mind <br />
                 Can by mere thinking the unsizeable <br />
                 Creatures of sea enslave! I must believe it. <br />
                 The mind hath many powers beyond name <br />
                 Deep womb'd within it, and can shoot strange vigours: <br />
                 Men there have been who could so grimly look <br />
                 That soldiers' hearts went out like candle flames <br />
                 Before their eyes, and the blood perisht in them. -- <br />
                 But I -- could I do that? Would I not feel <br />
                 The power in me if 'twas there? And yet <br />
                 'Twere a child's game to what I have to do, <br />
                 For days and days with sleepless faith oppress <br />
                 And terrorise the demon sea. I think <br />
                 A man might, as I saw my Master once, <br />
                 Pass unharmed through a storm of men, yet fail <br />
                 At this that lies before me: men are mind, <br />
                 And mind can conquer mind; but how can it quell <br />
                 The unappointed purpose of great waters? -- <br />
                 Well, say the sea is past: why, then, I have <br />
                 My feet but on the threshold of my task, <br />
                 To gospel India, -- my single heart <br />
                 To seize into the order of its beat <br />
                 All the strange blood of India, my brain <br />
                 To lord the dark thought of that tann'd mankind! -- <br />
                 O, horrible those sweltry places are, <br />
                 Where the sun comes so close, it makes the earth <br />
                 Burn in a frenzy of breeding, -- smoke and flame <br />
                 Of lives burning up from agoniz'd loam! <br />
                 Those monstrous sappy jungles of clutcht growth, <br />
                 What can such fearful increase have to do <br />
                 With prospering bounty? A rage works in the ground, <br />
                 Incurably, like frantic lechery, <br />
                 Pouring its passion out in crops and spawns. <br />
                 'Tis as the mighty spirit of life, that here <br />
                 Walketh beautifully praising, glad of God, <br />
                 Should, stepping on the poison'd Indian shore, <br />
                 Breathing the Indian air of fire snd steams, <br />
                 Fling herself into a craze of hideous dancing, <br />
                 The green gown whipping her swift limbs, all her body <br />
                 Writhen to speak inutterable desire, <br />
                 Tormented by a glee of hating God. <br />
                 Nay, it must be, to visit India, <br />
                 That frantic pomp and hurrying forth of life, <br />
                 As if a man should enter at unawares <br />
                 The dreaming mind of Satan, gorgeously <br />
                 Imagining his eternal hell of lust. -- <br />
                 They say the land is full of apes, which have <br />
                 Their own gods and worship: how ghastly, this! -- <br />
                 That demons (for it must be so) should build, <br />
                 In mockery of man's upward faith, the souls <br />
                 Of monkeys, those lewd mammets of mankind, <br />
                 Into a dreadful farce of adoration! <br />
                 And flies! a land of flies! where the hot soil <br />
                 Foul with ceaseless decay steams into flies! <br />
                 So thick they pile themselves in the air above <br />
                 Their meal of filth, they seem like breathing heaps <br />
                 Of formless life mounded upon the earth; <br />
                 And buzzing always like the pipes and strings <br />
                 Of solemn music made for sorcerers. -- <br />
                 I abhor flies, -- to see them stare upon me <br />
                 Out of their little faces of gibbous eyes; <br />
                 To feel the dry cool skin of their bodies alight <br />
                 Perching upon my lips! -- O yea, a dream, <br />
                 A dream of impious obscene Satan, this <br />
                 Monstrous frenzy of life, the Indian being! <br />
                 And there are men in the dream! What men are they? <br />
                 I've heard, naught relishes their brains so much <br />
                 As to tie down a man and tease his flesh <br />
                 Infamously, until a hundred pains <br />
                 Hound the desiring life out of his body, <br />
                 Filling his nerves with such a fearful zest <br />
                 That the soul overstrained shatters beneath it. <br />
                 Must I preach God to these murderous hearts? <br />
                 I would my lot had fallen to go and dare <br />
                 Death from the silent dealing of Northern cold! -- <br />
                 O, but I would face all these Indian fears, <br />
                 The horror of the huge power of life, <br />
                 The beasts all fierce and venomous, the men <br />
                 With cruel souls, learned to invent pain, <br />
                 All these and more, if I had any hope <br />
                 That, braving them, Lord Christ prosper'd through me. <br />
                 If Christ desired India, He had sent <br />
                 The band of us, solder'd in one great purpose, <br />
                 To strike His message through those dark vast tribes. <br />
                 But one man! -- O surely it is folly, <br />
                 And we misread the lot! One man, to thrust, <br />
                 Even though in his soul the lamp was kindled <br />
                 At God's own hands, one man's lit soul to thrust <br />
                 The immense Indian darkness out of the world! <br />
                 For human flesh there breeds as furiously <br />
                 As the green things and the cattle; and it is all, <br />
                 All this enormity of measureless folk, <br />
                 Penn'd in a land so close to the devil's reign <br />
                 The very apes have faith in him. -- No, no; <br />
                 Impetuous brains mistake the signs of God <br />
                 Too easily. God would not have me waste <br />
                 My zeal for Him in this wild enterprise, <br />
                 Of going alone to swarming India; -- one man, <br />
                 One mortal voice, to charm those myriad ears <br />
                 Away from the fiendish clamour of Indian gods, <br />
                 One man preaching the truth against the huge <br />
                 Bray of the gongs and horns of the Indian priests! <br />
                 A cup of wine poured in the sea were not <br />
                 More surely lost in the green and brackish depths, <br />
                 Than the fire and fragrance of my doctrine poured <br />
                 Into that multitudinous pond of men, <br />
                 India. -- Shipman! Master of the ship! -- <br />
                 I have thought better of this journey; now <br />
                 I find I am not meant to go. <br />
           Captain                          Not meant? <br />
           Thomas <br />
                 I would say, I had forgotten Indian air <br />
                 Is full of fevers; and my health is bad <br />
                 For holding out against fever. <br />
           Captain                     As you please. <br />
                 I keep your fare, though. <br />
           Thomas                O,{ 'tis yours. -- Good sailing! <br />
                 As he makes to depart, a Noble Stranger is seen approaching along the quay. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 Well, here's a marvel: 'Tis a king, for sure! <br />
                 'Twould take the taxes of a world to dress <br />
                 A man in that silken gold, and all those gems. <br />
                 What a flash the light makes of him, nay, he burns; <br />
                 And he's here on the quay all by himself, <br />
                 Not even a slave to fan him! -- Man, you're ailing! <br />
                 You look like death; is it the falling sickness? <br />
                 Or has the mere thought of the Indian journey <br />
                 Made your marrow quail with a cold fever? <br />
           The Stranger (to the Captain) <br />
                 You are the master of this ship? <br />
           Captain                           I am. <br />
           Stranger <br />
                 This huddled man belongs to me: a slave <br />
                 Escaped my service. <br />
           Captain                  Lord, I knew not that. <br />
                 But you are in good time. <br />
           Stranger                    And was the slave <br />
                 For putting out with you? Where are your bound? <br />
           Captain <br />
                 To India. First he would sail, and then <br />
                 Again he would not. But, my Lord, I swear <br />
                 I never guesst he was a runaway. <br />
           Stranger <br />
                 Well, he shall have his mind and go with you <br />
                 To India: a good slave he is, but bears <br />
                 A restless thought. He has slipt off before, <br />
                 And vexes me still to be watching him. <br />
                 We'll make a bargain of him. <br />
           Captain                         I, my Lord? <br />
                 I have no need of slaves: I am too poor. <br />
           Stranger <br />
                 For twenty silver pieces he is yours. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 That's cheap, if he has a skill. Yes, there might be <br />
                 Profit in him at that. Has he a trade? <br />
           Stranger <br />
                 He is a carpenter. <br />
           Captain                          A carpenter! <br />
                 Why, for a good one I'ld give all my purse. <br />
           Stranger <br />
                 No, twenty silver pieces is the price; <br />
                 Though 'tis a slave a king might joy to own. <br />
                 I've taught him to imagine palaces <br />
                 So high, and tower'd so nobly, they might seem <br />
                 The marvelling of a God-delighted heart <br />
                 Escaping into ecstasy; he knows, <br />
                 Moreover, of a stuff so rare it makes <br />
                 Smaragdus and the dragon-stone despised; <br />
                 And yet the quarries whereof he is wise <br />
                 Would yield enough to house the tribes of the world <br />
                 In palaces of beautiful shining work. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 Lo there! why, that is it: the carpenter <br />
                 I am to bring is needed for to build <br />
                 The king's new palace. <br />
           Stranger                      Yea? He is your man. <br />
           Captain <br />
                 Come on, my man. I'll put your cunning heels <br />
                 Where they'll not budge more than a shuffled inch. <br />
                 My lord, if you'll bide with the rascal here <br />
                 I'll get the irons ready. Here's your sum. -- <br />
           Stranger <br />
                 Now, Thomas, know thy sin. It was not fear; <br />
                 Easily may a man crouch down for fear, <br />
                 And yet rise up on firmer knees, and face <br />
                 The hailing storm of the world with graver courage. <br />
                 But prudence, prudence is the deadly sin, <br />
                 And one that groweth deep into a life, <br />
                 With hardening roots that clutch about the breast. <br />
                 For this refuses faith in the unknown powers <br />
                 Within man's nature; shrewdly bringeth all <br />
                 Their inspiration of strange eagerness( <br />
                 To a judgment bought by safe experience; <br />
                 Narrows desire into the scope of thought. <br />
                 But it is written in the heart of man, <br />
                 Thou shalt no larger be than thy desire. <br />
                 Thou must not therefore stoop thy spirit's sight <br />
                 To pore only within the candle-gleam <br />
                 Of conscious wit and reasonable brain; <br />
                 But search into the sacred darkness lying <br />
                 Outside thy knowledge of thyself, the vast <br />
                 Measureless fate, full of the power of stars, <br />
                 The outer noiseless heavens of thy soul. <br />
                 Keep thy desire closed in the room of light <br />
                 The labouring fires of thy mind have made, <br />
                 And thou shalt find the vision of thy spirit <br />
                 Pitifully dazzled to so shrunk a ken, <br />
                 There are no spacious puissances about it. <br />
                 But send desire often forth to scan <br />
                 The immense night which is thy greater soul; <br />
                 Knowing the possible, see thou try beyond it <br />
                 Into impossible things, unlikely ends; <br />
                 And thou shalt find thy knowledgeable desire <br />
                 Grow large as all the regions of thy soul, <br />
                 Whose firmament doth cover the whole of Being, <br />
                 And of created purpose reach the ends.</p>
