							<p>Fall fell:  so that's it for the leaf poetry: <br />
some flurries have whitened the edges of roads <br />
<br />
and lawns: time for that, the snow stuff: & <br />
turkeys and old St. Nick: where am I going to <br />
<br />
find something to write about I haven't already <br />
written away: I will have to stop short, look <br />
<br />
down, look up, look close, think, think, think: <br />
but in what range should I think: should I <br />
<br />
figure colors and outlines, given forms, say <br />
mailboxes, or should I try to plumb what is <br />
<br />
behind what and what behind that, deep down <br />
where the surface has lost its semblance: or <br />
<br />
should I think personally, such as, this week <br />
seems to have been crafted in hell: what: is <br />
<br />
something going on: something besides this <br />
diddledeediddle everyday matter-of-fact: I <br />
<br />
could draw up an ancient memory which would <br />
wipe this whole presence away: or I could fill <br />
<br />
out my dreams with high syntheses turned into <br />
concrete visionary forms: Lucre could lust <br />
<br />
for Luster: bad angels could roar out of perdition <br />
and kill the AIDS vaccine not quite <br />
<br />
perfected yet: the gods could get down on <br />
each other; the big gods could fly in from <br />
<br />
nebulae unknown: but I'm only me: I have 4 <br />
interests--money, poetry, sex, death: I guess <br />
<br />
I can jostle those. . . .</p>
