							<p>It was May before my <br />
attention came <br />
to spring and <br />
<br />
my word I said <br />
to the southern slopes <br />
I've <br />
<br />
missed it, it <br />
came and went before <br />
I got right to see: <br />
<br />
don't worry, said the mountain, <br />
try the later northern slopes <br />
or if <br />
<br />
you can climb, climb <br />
into spring: but <br />
said the mountain <br />
<br />
it's not that way <br />
with all things, some <br />
that go are gone</p>
