# java_poetry_app

Scrapes the website [mypoeticside.com](https://mypoeticside.com) for poems and saves them in seperate text files.
This app served the twofold purpose of sharpening my java skills and exposing me to more poetry.

Functional app is the v2.java
Use the different functions (get authors, get list of poems of the authors, save the poems) seperately and one at a time.

Favorite poems I discored:
Anna Laetitia Barbauld - A though on death
Zabel Asadour - Tears
