# java_poetry_app

## Overview:
Scrapes the website [mypoeticside.com](https://mypoeticside.com) for poems and saves them in seperate text files.  
This app is not intended to be very user friendly, so you'll have to read the code to use it properly. I will however provide some basic instructions.
This app primarily serves as a boost to my application to work for my church, who need Java developers to work on their expanding tech infrastucture.
This app served the twofold purpose of sharpening my java skills and exposing me to more poetry.  

## Basic instructions:
Functional app is the v2.java  
Use the different functions (get authors, get list of poems of the authors, save the poems) seperately and one at a time.

## Favorite poems I discored:
Anna Laetitia Barbauld - A though on death  
Zabel Asadour - Tears
