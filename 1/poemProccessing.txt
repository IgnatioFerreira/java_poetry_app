							<p>In heaven, my friend, your deep-blue flowers will grow<br />
forever. You will see the true condition<br />
of everything: will see what, here below,<br />
you only glimpsed with darkling intuition ---<br />
only divined through spiritual force ---<br />
of life's hid currents and deep aspirations;<br />
will scan the flood --- past men's imaginations ---<br />
and gaze with joy on truth's immortal source.<br />
<br />
For you were truth's own champion, valiant, free,<br />
armored with youth and sturdy self-possession,<br />
a man who made himself, as I could see<br />
reading your bold, self-confident expression.<br />
With all your soul you searched for truth, among<br />
the high and beautiful, the pure and holy ---<br />
this is no idle fancy! --- and you slowly<br />
mounted truth's towering ladder, rung by rung.<br />
<br />
Yet if your soul, at freedom in the skies,<br />
should turn its gaze upon the stream of being<br />
that flows forever, and not recognize<br />
it --- and yourself --- and know what it was seeing,<br />
then (why not think the thought out to its end,<br />
so bleak my soul rejects it like a liar!) ---<br />
then life's Lord could not be life's Father, Drejer,<br />
and God could not be our God --- or our friend.<br />
<br />
Farewell! We think of you with every breath,<br />
our circle shattered, glassy-eyed, unsleeping;<br />
we weep your unanticipated death,<br />
though life can spare us little time for weeping.<br />
--- You hurry on, winged spirit, all the while,<br />
spurning this dark and dust for life immortal.<br />
Behold God's realm! And there, at mercy's portal,<br />
greet us one day with your familiar smile.</p>
