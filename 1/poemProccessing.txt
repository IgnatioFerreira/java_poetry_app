							<p>There is no transcience of twilight in<br />
     The beauty of your soft dusk-dimpled face,<br />
     No flicker of a slender flame in space,<br />
In crucibles, fragility crystalline.<br />
There is no fragrance of the jessamine<br />
     About you, no pathos of some old place<br />
     At dusk, that crumbles like moth-eater lace<br />
Beneath the touch. Nor has there ever been.<br />
<br />
Your love is like the folk-song's flaming rise<br />
     In cane-lipped southern people, like their soul<br />
            Which burst its bondage in a bold travail;<br />
Your voice is like them singing, soft and wise,<br />
     Your face, sweetly efflgent of the whole,<br />
     Inviolate of ways that would feile.</p>
